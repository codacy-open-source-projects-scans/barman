    External Configuration Files
        Files that are stored outside of PGDATA. For example, when you create a new
        PostgreSQL cluster using ``pg_createcluster`` (e.g.,
        ``sudo pg_createcluster 14 main``) in Ubuntu, it sets up a new data directory,
        typically under ``/var/lib/postgresql/``, but the configuration files, like
        ``postgresql.conf`` and ``pg_hba.conf``, are usually stored under
        ``/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/`` to separate them from the actual data.
